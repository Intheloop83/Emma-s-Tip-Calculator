# Emma's Tip Calculator
# Creating a Tip Calculator
# Project version- Python 3
# Project Description- This code allows users to input information regarding the price they paid for their meal, the percentage they wish to pay as a tip and the number of people they will be dividing the bill with. The user is also informed of a 10% sales tax that will be added to their bill. The calculator will determine how much the individual will pay for taxes based on the amount of their bill, as well as the dollar amount for their tip and tax. The user will be given their total amount which will then be divided equally amongst the number of individuals they specify will be dividing the bill. This will let the user know how much each person will pay.
